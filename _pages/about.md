## About Me
Hello! I’m Likun Liu, a Master’s student in Communication and Education at [Teachers College, Columbia University](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/). I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Translation and Interpretation with minors in Psychology and Sociology from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), where I graduated with honors as one of the top students in my program.

I am deeply passionate about blending my academic background with my professional aspirations in UI/UX design, communications, and marketing. My goal is to create meaningful user experiences and impactful content that connect people, ideas, and communities. Whether it's through crafting intuitive interfaces or leading marketing strategies, I am driven by the desire to foster engagement and innovation in everything I do.

Feel free to connect with me—I’m always open to exploring exciting opportunities and collaborations!
