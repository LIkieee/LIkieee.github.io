Memory Waltz is a two-player cooperative puzzle game where players work across two time periods - present day with an elderly couple facing Alzheimer's, and their past in the 1940s. Through cooperative puzzles and synchronized actions, players help reconstruct their fading memories of love. Created during GDevelop BIG Game Jam #6 in 10 days, I served as designer and PM, leading gameplay conceptualization and ensuring delivery of our prototype that explores how love transcends both time and memory.
