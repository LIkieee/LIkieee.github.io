LittlePaws is an educational course project I'm leading, designed as a comprehensive pet development platform to help pet owners visualize and manage their pet parenting journey. As the team leader and primary programmer, I spearheaded the project conceptualization and development, successfully delivering three core features in our initial phase: a health management system, a photo-based timeline for documenting growth milestones, and an interactive pet event calendar. I architected and implemented the entire current system, including the landing page and core features, establishing a robust framework for future development.
