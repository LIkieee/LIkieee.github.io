This 2D educational game was developed in one week during the “Game Research Lab's Game Sprint”, earning the “Most Educational Game” award. Players collect and recycle trash, create upcycled products, and protect marine life. As the designer and PM, I guided the concept, mechanics, and educational focus to promote environmental awareness.
